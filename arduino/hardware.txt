Basics:
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x Ethernet shield

Humidity/temperature sensor:
- 1x DHT11 humidity sensor (accuracy: +-5% RH ; +-2°C)
- 1x 10kΩ or 5kΩ resistor (as pull-up)

Detecting door opening:
- 1x or more pushbutton
- 1x 10kΩ resistor (pull-down)

To light up external 12V leds on door opening:
- 1x diode 1N4001 series (just to be sure the 12V current is properly wired)
- 1x n-type MOSFET IRF520
