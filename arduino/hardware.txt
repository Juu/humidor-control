Board:
- 1x ESP-01 module (based on ESP8266 chip)
- 2x 1kΩ pull-up resistors for RST and CH_PD pins

Power supply:
- 1x LD1117V33 voltage regulator
- 1x diode 1N4001 series (just to make sure the input 12V is properly wired)
- 1x 100nF capacitor
- 1x 10µF capacitor

Humidity/temperature sensor:
- 1x DHT11 humidity sensor (accuracy: +-5% RH ; +-2°C)
- 1x 10kΩ or 5kΩ resistor (as pull-up)

Detecting door opening:
- 1x or more pushbutton (wired in parallel) open when humidoors are closed
- 1x NPN bipolar transistor (used with the 3 resistors to act as a NOT logic gate to keep ESP8266's GPIO_2 input high on startup)
- 1x 33Ω resistor
- 2x 100Ω resistor

To light up external 12V leds on door opening:
- 1x n-type MOSFET IRF520
